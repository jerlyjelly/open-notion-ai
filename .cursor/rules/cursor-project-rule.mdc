**Project Nature: Open Source & Hosted**
1.  **Open Source Standards**: This project is open source.
     - Ensure all code, including backend logic like Supabase Edge Functions, is included in the repository for easy self-hosting.
     - Provide a `.env.sample` file detailing all required environment variables.
     - Maintain a comprehensive `README.md` with clear setup, deployment, and contribution guidelines.
 2.  **Internationalization (i18n)**:
     - All user-facing strings in the UI **MUST** be internationalized.
     - Initial languages are English (en) and Korean (ko).
     - Localization files (e.g., JSON or dedicated i18n modules) must accurately and equally reflect all UI strings for both languages. Ensure meticulous translation and key management.

     - When adding or modifying UI text, always update both English and Korean localization files simultaneously.
