**Project Nature: Open Source & Hosted**
1.  **Open Source Standards**: This project is open source.
     - Ensure all code, including backend logic like Supabase Edge Functions, is included in the repository for easy self-hosting.
     - Provide a `.env.sample` file detailing all required environment variables.
     - Maintain a comprehensive `README.md` with clear setup, deployment, and contribution guidelines.
     - It is important that you consider all backend functions to be deployed to be able to be replicated by other users when hosting themselves.
